    display : block     // changes inline elements to block. It's box size takes whole width and height is size of content
    display : inline-block // changes element to have both inline and block property to adjust width of element while inline
    display : none      //  disappears from screen and other elements take over the spot
    visibility : hidden // disappears from screen BUT leaves the given spot. other elements cant take over the spot

    POSITION
    position : static   //  default.
    position : relative //  you can move coordinates(top bottom left right) from !!!its original position!!!
                        //  nothing happens until you give coordinates property.
    position : absolute //  margin to its own PARENT element.
    position : fixed    //  stay fixed to its given coordinates when you scroll down

    ALIGN
    text-align : center //  declared in body will make all inline elements to center.
    margin : 0 auto 0 auto; // if elemnt is block and has width setting by doing this items will move to center

    FONT
    font-family : serif     // default.
    font-family : sans-serif     // ariel font
    font-size : 1em = 16px = 100%  // px is an absolute unit no matter they see screen in small medium or large.
                                    // em and % gets inherited from parents font size. if parent had font size setting already, size will add up to its assigned font size
                                    // rem ignores parents font size and doesnt get inherited.
